/**
 * solution description:
 *      G(n): the numbre of unique BST for a sequence of length n
 *      F(i,n): the number of unique BST, where the number i is served as the root of BST (1<=i<=n)
 *
 *      G(n) = F(1,n) + F(2,n) + ... + F(n-1,n) + F(n,n)
 *
 * bottom cases:
 *      G(0) = 1 (empty tree)
 *      G(1) = 1 (only a root)
 *
 * cartesian product:
 *      F(i,n) = combinations of i's left subtree and i's right subtree, which is
 *               i's left subtree contains 1, 2, ..., i - 1
 *               i's right subtree contains i + 1, i + 2, ..., n
 *          e.g. F(3, 7) = combinations of left subtree [1,2] and right subtree [4,5,6,7]
 *               F(3, 7) = G(2) * G(4)
 *               it means the result does not matter the content of the sequence, but the length of the sequence
 *          so,
 *      F(i,n) = G(i - 1) * G(n - i)
 *          then,
 *      G(n) = âˆ‘ {G(i - 1) * G(n - i)}  (1<=i<=n)

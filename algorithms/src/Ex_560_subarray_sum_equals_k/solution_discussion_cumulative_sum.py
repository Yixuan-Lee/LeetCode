Reference:
https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/solution/

Idea:
in the brute force approach, we can figure out that there are (end-start) overlapped elements
between two indices, but we repeatedly compute the sum of overlapped elements.
thus we can make use of a cumulative sum array called ssum,
    ssum[i] = Î£_{j=0}^{i-1} {nums[j]}
base case:
    ssum[0] = 0
then in order to calculate the sum of elements laying between [start, end], we can
subtract the cumulative sum corresponding the two indices to obtain the sum of elements nums[start...end]

Time complexity: O(n^2) [TLE]
Space compelxity: O(n)
